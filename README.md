_"I really enjoy the satisfaction of fixing things, because it often means taking them apart and understanding how they work first - and if there is nothing to fix - taking them apart anyway!" - Me_

My work as a Consultant at [@Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) allows me to take my customers on a journey - taking apart their technologies, processes and desires - finding understanding - and rebulduilding them in a way that empowers everyone to do more. The technologies I use has varied over the years from C# to Microsoft System Center 💾 and more recentlty ☁️ Azure, Terraform, BICEP and DevOps - but the human challenges and opportunities seldom differ - and its the lure of helping others overcome them that keeps me engaged.

When I can find the time I pilot & work on Motorcycles 🏍️ and Cars 🚗 , play Amatuer Radio 📻, [help preserve steam trains](https://www.darjeelingtank.org.uk/) 🚂 perpetually put off learning the Tenor Sax 🎷 and slowly turn my home into an Enterprise Class datacentre ⚡ to power my IoT and Home Automation desires.
