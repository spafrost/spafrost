_"I really enjoy the satisfaction of fixing things, because it often means taking them apart and understanding how they work first - and if there is nothing to fix - taking them apart anyway!" - Me_

My work as a Consultant at [@Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) allows me to take my customers on a journey - taking apart their technologies, processes and desires - finding understanding - and rebulduilding them in a way that empowers everyone to do more. The technologies I use has varied over the years from C# to Microsoft System Center and more recentlty Azure, Terraform, BICEP and YAML - but the human challenges and opportunities seldom differ - and its the lure of helping others overcome them that drives me.

When I can find the time I pilot & work on Motorcycles and Cars, play Amatuer Radio, perpetually put off learning the Tenor Sax and slowly turn my home into an Enterprise Class datacentre to power my IoT and Home Automation desires.
